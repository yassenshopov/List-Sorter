# List Sorter - A Statistics 101 Tool

This Python script allows the user to add numerous numerical inputs into a list. The list then sorts them by value, calculates the average, median, mode(s), the variance, and the standard deviation of entries. 

## Installation

The program only requies the math library, which comes pre-installed on Python3


## Usage

This function will request integers/floats as input, one at a time.

After you have entered all your inputs, this function will sort the list 
and present the average, median, and mean values.

Once you have entered all your inputs, simply press ENTER to get the result.

The outputs will be presented in the end of the program, in the terminal window.
